## Environment Config ##

To access the Time Series Insights API you first have to setup an environment in Azure, details here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-get-started

You then need to configure authentication, instructions here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-authentication-and-authorization

Once you have completed these steps and have your authentication details you can begin to use Chronological to access data.
